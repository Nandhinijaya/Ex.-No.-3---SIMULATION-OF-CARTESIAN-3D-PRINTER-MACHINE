Smooth Rod: The two smooth rods on both the corners of the machine in parallel to each other. These smooth rods will be passing through a linear bearing block
Bearing : A bearing is defined as a mechanical component that constrains relative movement to the desired motion within the same axis and also reduces friction between moving parts.
USES of Bearing in 3D printing systems enhance motion control, minimize vibrations, reduce friction, and contribute to the accuracy and precision of the printing process.

Idler : An idler wheel usually is a round bearing pushed by a spring or a rubber bushing.
USES:the idler plays a critical role in ensuring proper filament tension, guiding the filament, preventing filament jams, and maintaining consistent filament feeding during the 3D printing process.

Extruder:An extruder is simply the machine used to complete the extrusion process. Using a system of barrels and cylinders, the machine heats up the product and propels it through the die to create the desired shape

Motor: 
     Motors are responsible for driving the movement of various components, controlling filament feeding, regulating temperature, and achieving precise positioning

  LCD:
          An LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a type of screen used in resin-based 3D printers that utilize a technology called LCD-based Masked Stereolithography (MSLA) or Digital Light Processing (DLP).
          
          
Spool Holder:
           A spool holder is a device or component used to hold the filament spool securely during the printing process.
           
Spool:
           A spool refers to the cylindrical holder or container that holds the filament. Filament spools are commonly used in FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3D printers, where a continuous filament of thermoplastic material is fed into the printer for the printing process
